This week we started to talk about differential equations and for the lecture I was looking for an example of a broadely used <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation>first order ODE</a>: my final choice has been the logistic equation.</p><p>It is a fairly simple differential equation that is used to describe the growth (and saturation) of populations in environments with competition for limited resources. Before entering into more details I think it&rsquo;s time to digress slightly and talk about something simpler.</p><p>###How can one describe the growth of a population of bacteria (assuming that they do not die)?</p><p>We could start by thinking that <em>the rate of growth of the population of bacteria is proportional to the existing number of cells</em>. In this case we would consider the equation</p><p>$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = r P(t)
$$</p><p>where where $r > 0$ describes the growth rate and $P(t)$ is the quantity describing the number of cells at time $t$ (the population size).</p><p>The solution of such equation is a simple exponential (if you don&rsquo;t trust me, trust at least <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=dP%2Fdt+%3D+r+P%28t%29">wolfram alpha</a>):</p><p>$$
P(t) = c e^{rt}.
$$</p><p>Now, if we know that the population of bacteria at time $t=0$ consists of $P_0>0$ cells (e.g. $10$), we can take it as initial condition and get</p><p>$$
c = P_0,
$$</p><p>as one would expect. And therefore we could predict how many bacteria we can count at a certain time $t$ using</p><p>$$
P(t) = P_0 e^{rt}.
$$</p><p>While bacteria are very small and it would take a long time for them to consume all the food and all the available space, it seems clear that <strong>this model is extremely unralistic when we consider the growth of a population of bigger entities</strong> (e.g. humans, rabbits, mices, economy, users of facebook, &mldr;). Clearly for such systems the finiteness of the resourcces (e.g. space or nutrition) would become soon apparent.</p><p>Doesn&rsquo;t it!?! Think about it, our whole economic system is blindly based on the fact that economy/production/population/consumes can keep growing forever&mldr; Something sounds wrong: at a certain point it will be clear that our resources are finite. What will happen then <em>(assuming that it&rsquo;s not too late to do something)</em>?</p><p>Anyway&mldr; Let&rsquo;s forget about catastrophes and let&rsquo;s go back to our model</p><h3 id=a-slightly-improved-model-for-population-growth><a class=hanchor href=#a-slightly-improved-model-for-population-growth>#</a>&nbsp;A slightly improved model for population growth</h3><p>To describe the growth of a population in an environment with competition for limited resources we need to <em>modify the equation above and include a term that slows down the growth when the population becomes too big with respect to the resources</em>.</p><p>This equation is called <strong>logistic equation</strong> (sometimes you find it as Verhulst equation):</p><p>$$
\frac{d P}{dt} = r P(t) \left(1 - \frac{P(t)}{K}\right)
$$</p><p>where $r>0$ is the rate of growth (as before) and $K > P_0$ is a parameter that measures what is the maximal amount of resources (or, from a different point of view, how big our population can become).</p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_variables>Separating variables</a> we can easily solve the equation and, with some algebra we get</p><p>$$
\frac{K P}{K-P} = \frac{P}{1-P/K} = C e^{rt}.
$$</p><p>As for the bacteria, let&rsquo;s say that at time $t=0$ our population consists of $0 &lt; P_0 &lt; K$ individuals. Then we easily get</p><p>$$
C = \frac{K P_0}{K - P_0}
$$</p><p>and therefore (with few other algebraic steps) we get as solution the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function>logistic function</a>:</p><p>$$
P(t) = \frac{ K P_0 e^{rt} }{ K + P_0 ( e^{rt} -1 )}.
$$</p><p>If you compare this solution with the exponential growth of the bacteria you can notice that there is a huge difference. The logistic growth presents an horizontal asymptote for $t\to \infty$, i.e. the population grows slower and slower until it saturates the environment and is not able to grow anymore.</p><p><img src=/images/17-logistic.png alt="Logistic and exponential growth with $r=1$, $K=3$, $P_0=0.25$"></p><p>Remember this graph when you look to graphs describing the incredible growth of something. You should not be surprised if you recognise it.</p><p>Make an experiment, look to a graph of the diffusion of internet on your country (or in the world), or to one about the production of crops or oil, or to the <a href=https://www.google.co.uk/trends>Google Trends</a> graph of searches for different social networks.</p><p><img src=/images/17-trends.png alt="Trends for different social networks"></p><p>Note that if you set $K=2A/B$, $r=B$ and $P_0 = K/(1+e^{BC})$, for some numbers $A,B,C$ whose meaning I don&rsquo;t really know, you obtain the equation of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbert_peak_theory><strong>Hubbert Model of Oil Production</strong></a> that is used to predict when the maximum of oil production will be reached and how the production will behave afterward.</p><p>Note, moreover, that in the limit $K\to+\infty$ we go back to the exponential growth model.</p><p>Finally, do not confuse this logistic equation with the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map>logistic map</a>. They are strictly related but the study of the logistic map is a completely different story.</p></div><div class=post-footer><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=mseri/mseri.github.io issue-term=pathname label=✨💬✨ theme=photon-dark crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></article></main></body></html>
