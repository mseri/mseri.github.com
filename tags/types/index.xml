It has possibly been the most important and interesting announcement of Apple in the last few years and &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7835099">started an amount of discussions around the web&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the hours passing, we&amp;rsquo;ve found out that there was &lt;a href="https://swift-lang.org">at least another Swift&lt;/a> in the history of programming languages (with a similar icon) and that &lt;a href="https://nondot.org/sabre/">Swift is under development since 2010 and its father is Chris Lattner&lt;/a>, creator of &lt;code>clang&lt;/code> and &lt;code>LLVM&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
