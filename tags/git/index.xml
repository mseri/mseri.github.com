I&amp;rsquo;ve been using git for a while now and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a few things since then, that I think are worth sharing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not going to explain in detail what git is, how to install it and how it works; there are plenty of resources for that.
It will be enough for our purposes to know that &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com">&lt;code>git&lt;/code>&lt;/a> is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes in your files and collaborate with others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Git workflow for lazy mathematicians</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/git-workflow-for-lazy-mathematicians/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2013 16:40:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/git-workflow-for-lazy-mathematicians/</guid><description>&lt;p>This post is pretty old, You can refer to &lt;a href="https://www.mseri.me/a-brief-intro-to-git/">my new post here&lt;/a> for a more modern version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, what is &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com">git&lt;/a>? Citing its website&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
[It] is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In other words Git provides a source control repository that enables you to roll back code changes as needed, to merge the updates when collaborating with others and eventually to have an online backup of your work.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
