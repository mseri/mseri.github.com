If you have any interest in mathematics or programming, I am sure that this is something that you have to watch.
I am saying new because a similar course was held in 2010 by the same person, you can still watch it here: Erik Meijer&amp;rsquo;s MSDN Channel 9 lecture series on functional programming</description></item></channel></rss>
