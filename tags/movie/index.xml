Some of them were no longer available, some I still have to check, but &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/120725835">one caught my attention&lt;/a> and the other evening I decided to watch it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a little documentary on the last conference of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Scott_MacDonald_Coxeter">Donald Coexeter&lt;/a>, and I enjoed watching it very much. You can find it embedded below, and linked above. And while collecting links for this post I have also discovered &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220102093914/https://www.math.toronto.edu/mpugh/Coxeter.pdf">a nice writeup&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
