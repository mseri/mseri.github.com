I purposedly updated the script to be a bit more general and flexible (but not too much). At the end of the file I explain how to run it. You should make a backup before doing the update (the simplest way is probably running tar czf backup.tar.gz YOUR_GHOST_FOLDER). Be careful that there is no warranty with this script and I will not take any responsibility for claims or damages consequent to the use of it.</description></item><item><title>A simple script to update ghost</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/a-simple-script-to-update-ghost/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2013 19:04:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/a-simple-script-to-update-ghost/</guid><description>You can update your ghost engine in many different ways, two for all by hand or by using git.
I am personally using a very basic bash script. If you need a semiauthomatic way to run the update, you can just copy/download it from gist and adapt to your needs.
I think it is simple enough to require no explanation.</description></item></channel></rss>
