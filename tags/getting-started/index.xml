I had problems with my VPS provider and finally decided to simplify the management and opted for a statically generated website. Ghost was very light and did well its job, if I had a multi-user environment I would be sticking with it. I still keep all the content from the previous blog, including this post.
That&amp;rsquo;s just the welcome post of a succesful ghost installation.</description></item></channel></rss>
