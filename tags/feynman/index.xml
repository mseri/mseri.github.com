Feynman responded, asking Mr. Mano what he was now doing. The response: &amp;ldquo;studying the Coherence theory with some applications to the propagation of electromagnetic waves through turbulent atmosphere&amp;hellip; a humble and down-to-earth type of problem.&amp;rdquo;
Dear Koichi,
I was very happy to hear from you, and that you have such a position in the Research Laboratories.</description></item></channel></rss>
