Feynman responded, asking Mr. Mano what he was now doing. The response: &amp;ldquo;studying the Coherence theory with some applications to the propagation of electromagnetic waves through turbulent atmosphere&amp;hellip; a humble and down-to-earth type of problem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dear Koichi,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was very happy to hear from you, and that you have such a position in the
Research Laboratories. Unfortunately your letter made me unhappy for you seem
to be truly sad. It seems that the influence of your teacher has been to give
you a false idea of what are worthwhile problems. The worthwhile problems are
the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute
something to. A problem is grand in science if it lies before us unsolved and
we see some way for us to make some headway into it. I would advise you to take
even simpler, or as you say, humbler, problems until you find some you can
really solve easily, no matter how trivial. You will get the pleasure of
success, and of helping your fellow man, even if it is only to answer a
question in the mind of a colleague less able than you. You must not take away
from yourself these pleasures because you have some erroneous idea of what is
worthwhile.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
