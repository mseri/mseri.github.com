This week we started to talk about differential equations and for the lecture I was looking for an example of a broadely used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation">first order ODE&lt;/a>: my final choice has been the logistic equation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a fairly simple differential equation that is used to describe the growth (and saturation) of populations in environments with competition for limited resources. Before entering into more details I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to digress slightly and talk about something simpler.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
