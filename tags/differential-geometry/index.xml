This was a 3 hour long event in which I had the chance to give a high-level introduction to sub-Riemannian geometry and present some interesting results and open questions partly related to my research.
In the first part of the seminar I introduced what are sub-Riemannian structures, where do they come from and what are some of the major properties and open questions, using some famous examples to drive the discussion.</description></item><item><title>Lecture notes on Analysis on Manifolds</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/analysis-on-manifolds/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 13:17:25 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/analysis-on-manifolds/</guid><description>In the previous academic term I had the pleasure to teach Analysis on Manifolds, essentially an introduction to differential geometry for third year students.
In the course I tried to address the topic with the perspective that some of the students would be joining also my master course in Hamiltonian Mechanics later on next year. So many of the topics go in the direction of introducing the prerequisites for studying flows, symplectic geometry and sub-Riemannian geometry.</description></item></channel></rss>
