&lt;p>I find it quite interesting, both for getting to know Snowden and have a fast overview of many of the scandals that were made public by some of the published leaks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was very disappointed the last time I went back home in Italy to know that nobody cared and almost nobody knew about &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files">what was and is happening&lt;/a>. Not even the small discussion apart the very light hearted: &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been always known that they control everybody&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
