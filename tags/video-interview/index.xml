I find it quite interesting, both for getting to know Snowden and have a fast overview of many of the scandals that were made public by some of the published leaks.
I was very disappointed the last time I went back home in Italy to know that nobody cared and almost nobody knew about what was and is happening.</description></item></channel></rss>
