&lt;p>From the last time I moved from Oh-My-Zsh to &lt;a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto">Prezto&lt;/a>, a different &lt;a href="https://dotfiles.github.io">&lt;em>dotfiles framework&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it much lighter and faster than oh-my-zsh, despite not having the same amount of plugins and themes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, as far as I understood, prezto was born as a fork of oh-my-zsh and was later completely rewritten to be more zshish and better optimised.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
