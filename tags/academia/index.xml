In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5566">some incredible eulogies&lt;/a>, this has allowed a lot of little gems to resurface. Here I want to share one of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2003, Weinberg wrote a short note to PhD students in physics: &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201123022309/http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/files/nature.pdf" title="Steven Weinberg - Four Golden Lessons">&amp;ldquo;Four Golden Lessons&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Steven Strogatz ask me anything video</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/steven-strogatz-ama/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 13:10:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/steven-strogatz-ama/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a follow up from &lt;a href="https://www.mseri.me/on-doing-phd/" title="On doing a PhD">the previous post&lt;/a>.
I have stumbled upon a wonderful recent video by Steven Strogatz on Twitter which I believe could be extremely helpful for current and prospective PhD students in STEM, and for their advisors!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it is worth every minute of it:&lt;/p>

 &lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
 &lt;iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wZBEFmkmogs?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video">&lt;/iframe>
 &lt;/div>

&lt;p>Consider also listening to Strogatz&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/the-joy-of-x/">The Joy of x&lt;/a> podcast, it gives a beautiful, humane and informative snapshot into what research and researchers are like.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On doing a PhD (in STEM)</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/on-doing-phd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2020 10:45:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/on-doing-phd/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was asked a few times in the recent past if doing a PhD is worth the effort. Since then, I have been thinking of writing what I think on my blog but, as usual, I could never find the time for it.
Not long ago, Jacopo Bertolotti shared his thoughts on the same matter in a nice &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201122162854/https://twitter.com/j_bertolotti/status/1330547247948460032">twitter thread&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since that really resonated with what I had to say, I&amp;rsquo;ll let him speak also for me and add a few more comments at the end.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
