In that case everythong I did was for python 2.7.
Yesterday I decided to fully move to python 3.4. I&amp;rsquo;ve removed my python installation via homebrew and with it all the installed packages.
Moving to python 3 is straightforward if you have done the procedure described in my previous post, it all really reduces to replace every occurrence of python in that post with python3 and every occurrence of pip with pip3.</description></item></channel></rss>
