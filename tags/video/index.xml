I have stumbled upon a wonderful recent video by Steven Strogatz on Twitter which I believe could be extremely helpful for current and prospective PhD students in STEM, and for their advisors!
I think it is worth every minute of it:
Consider also listening to Strogatz' The Joy of x podcast, it gives a beautiful, humane and informative snapshot into what research and researchers are like.</description></item><item><title>Why privacy matters by Glenn Greenwald</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/posts/why-privacy-matters-by-glenn-greenwald/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2014 14:59:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/posts/why-privacy-matters-by-glenn-greenwald/</guid><description>I am so sorry that I needed so much time before watching this wonderfully inspiring TED video.
I really admire Snowden, Greenwald and all the people that are fighting to denounce the dangerous path that we are following.
It&amp;rsquo;s time to take action, even the smallest one coubl make a difference. Maybe we don&amp;rsquo;t see the threat now, but we cannot now what will happen in the future.</description></item></channel></rss>
