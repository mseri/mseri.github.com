I admit that I&amp;rsquo;ve should have done it ages ago. I actually regret not having done it ages ago, I would have saved a lot of time.
Moving your .bashrc to your new .zshrc is almost just copy and paste. And you suddently find yourself with a shell that makes you feel in the future!
If you additionally install oh my zsh, the only thing that your shell will be missing is the capability of making coffee.</description></item></channel></rss>
