You can find it here: https://gist.github.com/mseri/7059958
Updates for purity to support all the new features are going to be released very soon.
As you can read from the official announcement, the new release of Ghost comes with a huge amount of features and updates:
Static pages. You can now toggle any post to be a &amp;ldquo;page&amp;rdquo; from within your post settings menu.</description></item><item><title>A great workaround for targeting links in Ghost</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/a-great-workaround-for-targeting-links-in-ghost/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2013 15:53:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/a-great-workaround-for-targeting-links-in-ghost/</guid><description>When I am reading something, I hate to click on some link (that I will supposedly read later) and be redirected to the new page. I&amp;rsquo;d rather prefer the links to open in background in a new tab.
You may say that it is enough to click while pressing Command or Control and the page will be opened in a background tab, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the same. What if I accidentally click for example?</description></item><item><title>Update script explained</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/update-script-explained/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2013 14:02:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/update-script-explained/</guid><description>I am going to proceed step by step through the code of the script that I have posted few days ago.
I purposedly updated the script to be a bit more general and flexible (but not too much). At the end of the file I explain how to run it. You should make a backup before doing the update (the simplest way is probably running tar czf backup.tar.gz YOUR_GHOST_FOLDER). Be careful that there is no warranty with this script and I will not take any responsibility for claims or damages consequent to the use of it.</description></item><item><title>A simple script to update ghost</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/a-simple-script-to-update-ghost/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2013 19:04:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/a-simple-script-to-update-ghost/</guid><description>You can update your ghost engine in many different ways, two for all by hand or by using git.
I am personally using a very basic bash script. If you need a semiauthomatic way to run the update, you can just copy/download it from gist and adapt to your needs.
I think it is simple enough to require no explanation.</description></item><item><title>nginx, ghost 0.3.3 and modsecurity</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/nginx-ghost-0-3-3-and-modsecurity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2013 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/nginx-ghost-0-3-3-and-modsecurity/</guid><description>In my previous post, Ghost on Amazon EC2 without using sudo, I was proposing some way of running ghost without having to use sudo and with at least a minimal eye on security.
If you have followed one of the guides that I suggested, namely Dude Looks Like a Ghost, or you have installed your own modsecurity configuration you should have received a big page announcing an Error 403 right after the update of your ghost to version 0.</description></item><item><title>ghiOStSeven</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/ghiostseven/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2013 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/ghiostseven/</guid><description>Here we go. On github is finally available a new responsive ghost theme inspired by iOS7 look.
It is still a very preliminary version, a cleaning of the stylesheet and some additional tweaks are in progress.
In the next few days I will add a style for forms elements to look like they do in iOS7 and the social/rss icons on the boottom bar, aligned right.
In the meanwhile you can play with it (and may be pull some update for merging) going to github.</description></item><item><title>Ghost up and running on Amazon EC2</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/ghost-up-and-running-on-amazon-ec2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2013 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/ghost-up-and-running-on-amazon-ec2/</guid><description>I had my free Amazon EC2 instance waiting for this moment since my last use of it.
I spent my few free hours setting up a decent (I hope) theme for Ghost, and reading around what to do and what not to do to have it up and running. My main reference was the nice blog post How to set up an Amazon EC2 instance to host ghost for free.</description></item></channel></rss>
