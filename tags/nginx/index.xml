If you have followed one of the guides that I suggested, namely Dude Looks Like a Ghost, or you have installed your own modsecurity configuration you should have received a big page announcing an Error 403 right after the update of your ghost to version 0.</description></item><item><title>Ghost on Amazon EC2 without using sudo</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/posts/ghost-on-amazon-ec2-without-using-sudo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2013 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/posts/ghost-on-amazon-ec2-without-using-sudo/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking since yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post how to run the ghost blog at the user level, wihout the need of using sudo.
Use Nginx In a production environment I would probably run ghos as a nginx subdomain (i.e. ghost.mseri.me), eventually forwarding the domain to the same address (e.g. typing mseri.me you would end up automatically in ghost.mseri.me). For this purpose you either know by hearth how to do it, or you can follow one of the many tutorial available online.</description></item></channel></rss>
