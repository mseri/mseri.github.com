&lt;p>From the last time I moved from Oh-My-Zsh to &lt;a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto">Prezto&lt;/a>, a different &lt;a href="https://dotfiles.github.io">&lt;em>dotfiles framework&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it much lighter and faster than oh-my-zsh, despite not having the same amount of plugins and themes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, as far as I understood, prezto was born as a fork of oh-my-zsh and was later completely rewritten to be more zshish and better optimised.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On iTerm2 and solarized dark</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/on-iterm2-and-solarized-dark/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2013 18:45:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/on-iterm2-and-solarized-dark/</guid><description>&lt;p>This weekend I&amp;rsquo;ve spent some time to understand &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell">Z Shell&lt;/a>. I admit that I&amp;rsquo;ve should have done it ages ago. I actually regret not having done it ages ago, I would have saved a lot of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moving your &lt;code>.bashrc&lt;/code> to your new &lt;code>.zshrc&lt;/code> is almost just copy and paste. And you suddently find yourself with a shell that makes you feel in the future!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you additionally install &lt;a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh my zsh&lt;/a>, &lt;em>the only thing that your shell will be missing is the capability of making coffee&lt;/em>. The official description is literally true:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
