From the last time I moved from Oh-My-Zsh to Prezto, a different dotfiles framework. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it much lighter and faster than oh-my-zsh, despite not having the same amount of plugins and themes.
In fact, as far as I understood, prezto was born as a fork of oh-my-zsh and was later completely rewritten to be more zshish and better optimised.</description></item><item><title>On iTerm2 and solarized dark</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/on-iterm2-and-solarized-dark/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2013 18:45:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/on-iterm2-and-solarized-dark/</guid><description>This weekend I&amp;rsquo;ve spent some time to understand Z Shell. I admit that I&amp;rsquo;ve should have done it ages ago. I actually regret not having done it ages ago, I would have saved a lot of time.
Moving your .bashrc to your new .zshrc is almost just copy and paste. And you suddently find yourself with a shell that makes you feel in the future!
If you additionally install oh my zsh, the only thing that your shell will be missing is the capability of making coffee.</description></item></channel></rss>
