In addition to some incredible eulogies, this has allowed a lot of little gems to resurface. Here I want to share one of them.
In 2003, Weinberg wrote a short note to PhD students in physics: &amp;ldquo;Four Golden Lessons&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Steven Strogatz ask me anything video</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/steven-strogatz-ama/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 13:10:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/steven-strogatz-ama/</guid><description>This is a follow up from the previous post. I have stumbled upon a wonderful recent video by Steven Strogatz on Twitter which I believe could be extremely helpful for current and prospective PhD students in STEM, and for their advisors!
I think it is worth every minute of it:
Consider also listening to Strogatz' The Joy of x podcast, it gives a beautiful, humane and informative snapshot into what research and researchers are like.</description></item><item><title>On doing a PhD (in STEM)</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/on-doing-phd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2020 10:45:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/on-doing-phd/</guid><description>I was asked a few times in the recent past if doing a PhD is worth the effort. Since then, I have been thinking of writing what I think on my blog but, as usual, I could never find the time for it. Not long ago, Jacopo Bertolotti shared his thoughts on the same matter in a nice twitter thread.
Since that really resonated with what I had to say, I&amp;rsquo;ll let him speak also for me and add a few more comments at the end.</description></item></channel></rss>
