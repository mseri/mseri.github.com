I was quite impressed (and scared) to hear that continuous full charge/discharege of the battery will ruin their life, and that is a best practice to plug it before it goes under 20% of the charge and unplug it when it reaches 80% charge.
I wanted to post a link to that source but in some way I cannot find it anymore.</description></item></channel></rss>
