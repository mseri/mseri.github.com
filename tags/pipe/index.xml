I really find much more natural to see data moving from left to right.
Yesterday I was thinking that in Haskell everything is an expression and that you can easily define infix operators. Thus it must be possible to implement a shell-like pipe.</description></item><item><title>Piping with Swift</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/piping-with-swift/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2014 10:03:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/piping-with-swift/</guid><description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with Apple&amp;rsquo;s newborn Swift quite a lot. I have to say that I am really impressed, and except for few things that I hope will be smoothed in the next months (years?), I find Swift really enjoyable and readable.
However, there is one feature that I really miss. Something that I daily use with slightly different syntaxes in Sh, Haskell, Julia and Elixir: the pipe!
Can we implement a kind of pipe in Swift?</description></item></channel></rss>
