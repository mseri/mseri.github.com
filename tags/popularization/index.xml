One of the nice perks of being part of such incredible group of people (yes, I still wonder how I got there :P) was the opportunity to take a short course on dealing with the media and to record my &amp;ldquo;research minutes&amp;rdquo;, a short, 2 minutes long, video to popularize my work.
The video was published on Twitter some time ago, and is now available on youtube.</description></item></channel></rss>
