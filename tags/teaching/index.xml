To avoid losing it in the guts of our teaching CMS, I leave it here for posterity, practically copy-pasting it without edits because I am really tired :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The books on SpringerLinks linked below are accessible from our students for free via the university proxy but in general (unfortunately) not open access.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lecture notes on Analysis on Manifolds</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/analysis-on-manifolds/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 13:17:25 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/analysis-on-manifolds/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the previous academic term I had the pleasure to teach &lt;a href="https://www.rug.nl/ocasys/rug/vak/show?code=WBMA013-05">Analysis on Manifolds&lt;/a>, essentially an introduction to differential geometry for third year students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the course I tried to address the topic with the perspective that some of the students would be joining also my master &lt;a href="https://www.mseri.me/lecture-notes-hamiltonian-mechanics/" title="Hamiltonian Mechanics">course in Hamiltonian Mechanics&lt;/a> later on next year.
So many of the topics go in the direction of introducing the prerequisites for studying flows, symplectic geometry and sub-Riemannian geometry.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Micro Course in Spectral Sub Riemannian Geometry</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/micro-course-ddtandg/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 22:38:21 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/micro-course-ddtandg/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, I have had the pleasure and honour to give a &amp;ldquo;micro&amp;rdquo; course on spectral sub-Riemannian geometry for the &lt;a href="https://www.few.vu.nl/~trt800/ddtg.html">Dutch Differential Topology and Geometry seminar&lt;/a>.
Given the current global circumstances, the course was given via Zoom and the organizers and participants have been kind enough to have it recorded and published online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can access the recordings of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqM9_PzO5-M">first&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDR0jUMCHsc">second&lt;/a> lecture on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN0o3PUqaC_ZhPNuM846kgg">YouTube Channel of the DDT&amp;amp;G&lt;/a>.
The slides &lt;a href="https://www.few.vu.nl/~trt800/ddtg/serinotes.pdf">are also available&lt;/a> (beware, they are 99Mb of handwritten pdf!).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lecture notes on Hamiltonian mechanics (update)</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/hamiltonian-mechanics-ams/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2020 22:00:21 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/hamiltonian-mechanics-ams/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have just released a small update to the &lt;a href="https://www.mseri.me/lecture-notes-hamiltonian-mechanics/" title="Hamiltonian Mechanics">Hamiltonian Mechanics lecture notes&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/mseri/hammech20/releases/download/v1.1/hm.pdf" title="Lecture Notes v1.1 PDF">here&lt;/a>.
This contains some edits to improve the english and fix a few typos.
The lecture notes have also been approved to appear in the &lt;a href="https://www.ams.org/open-math-notes/omn-view-listing?listingId=110861">AMS Open Math Notes&lt;/a>, which seems to be a very nice initiative, full of very interesting and high quality content.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lecture notes on Hamiltonian mechanics</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/lecture-notes-hamiltonian-mechanics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 15:20:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/lecture-notes-hamiltonian-mechanics/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the last academic term, I had the great pleasure to teach Hamiltonian Mechanics, an optional master course for mathematics and physics students.
Even though the course was based on Arnold&amp;rsquo;s beautiful book, my plan for the course was to give a panoramic on the modern theory of integrable systems and perturbation theory. Of course, my grand plan, was way to optimistic. And between the time available, a bad flu and then the pandemic landing, we were able to do much less than what I hoped for.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On teaching mathematics - By V. I. Arnold</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/on-teaching-mathematics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2015 01:11:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/on-teaching-mathematics/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This is an extended text of the address at the discussion on teaching of mathematics in Palais de DÃ©couverte in Paris on 7 March 1997.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mathematics is a part of physics. Physics is an experimental science, a part of natural science. Mathematics is the part of physics where experiments are cheap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Jacobi identity (which forces the heights of a triangle to cross at one point) is an experimental fact in the same way as that the Earth is round (that is, homeomorphic to a ball). But it can be discovered with less expense.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
