I was quite impressed (and scared) to hear that continuous full charge/discharege of the battery will ruin their life, and that is a best practice to plug it before it goes under 20% of the charge and unplug it when it reaches 80% charge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to post a link to that source but in some way I cannot find it anymore. With google anyway I&amp;rsquo;ve found many trustable sources with suggestions on &lt;strong>how to preserve the life of li-ion or li-ion polymer batteries&lt;/strong>. A short summary of their tips is listed below, I hope it can be of help to other people.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
