On github is finally available a new responsive ghost theme inspired by iOS7 look.
It is still a very preliminary version, a cleaning of the stylesheet and some additional tweaks are in progress.
In the next few days I will add a style for forms elements to look like they do in iOS7 and the social/rss icons on the boottom bar, aligned right.
In the meanwhile you can play with it (and may be pull some update for merging) going to github.</description></item></channel></rss>
