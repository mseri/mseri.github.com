Only apparent solution was to disable and reenable periodically the wifi until it started working.
The issue was not present whene I was in my office or using public wifi&amp;rsquo;s around. And removing the network setup to have them reset to default didn&amp;rsquo;t help.</description></item><item><title>Shasumming files in ruby</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/posts/shasumming-files-in-ruby/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2013 22:33:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/posts/shasumming-files-in-ruby/</guid><description>Computing SHA-* hashes of files in ruby is in principle very easy.
You can either use the OpenSSL module or the digest one and the sytax is almost interchangeable. I am using the digest module just because it seems to be slightly faster (I timed it and on my machine it takes few milliseconds less).
My first code was
require &amp;#39;digest&amp;#39; filename = '/path/to/the/file' Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(File.read(filename)) Then I made the hashes for a folder containing files of different sizes.</description></item></channel></rss>
