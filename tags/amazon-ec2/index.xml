#&amp;nbsp;Use Nginx In a production environment I would probably run ghos as a nginx subdomain (i.e. ghost.mseri.me), eventually forwarding the domain to the same address (e.g. typing mseri.me you would end up automatically in ghost.mseri.me). For this purpose you either know by hearth how to do it, or you can follow one of the many tutorial available online.</description></item><item><title>Ghost up and running on Amazon EC2</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/ghost-up-and-running-on-amazon-ec2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2013 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/ghost-up-and-running-on-amazon-ec2/</guid><description>I had my free Amazon EC2 instance waiting for this moment since my last use of it.
I spent my few free hours setting up a decent (I hope) theme for Ghost, and reading around what to do and what not to do to have it up and running. My main reference was the nice blog post How to set up an Amazon EC2 instance to host ghost for free.</description></item></channel></rss>
