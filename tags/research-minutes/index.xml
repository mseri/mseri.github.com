One of the nice perks of being part of such incredible group of people (yes, I still wonder how I got there :P) was the opportunity to take a short course on dealing with the media and to record my &amp;ldquo;research minutes&amp;rdquo;, a short, 2 minutes long, video to popularize my work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The video was published on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YAGroningen/status/1441035218014687239">Twitter&lt;/a> some time ago, and is now available on youtube.
I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did enjoy recording it :)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
