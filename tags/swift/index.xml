I have to say that I am really impressed, and except for few things that I hope will be smoothed in the next months (years?), I find Swift really enjoyable and readable.
However, there is one feature that I really miss. Something that I daily use with slightly different syntaxes in Sh, Haskell, Julia and Elixir: the pipe!
Can we implement a kind of pipe in Swift?</description></item><item><title>Implementing Either type in Swift</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/posts/implementing-either-type-in-swift/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2014 14:11:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/posts/implementing-either-type-in-swift/</guid><description>It has been only a couple of days since Apple announced and released Swift. It has possibly been the most important and interesting announcement of Apple in the last few years and started an amount of discussions around the web.
With the hours passing, we&amp;rsquo;ve found out that there was at least another Swift in the history of programming languages (with a similar icon) and that Swift is under development since 2010 and its father is Chris Lattner, creator of clang and LLVM.</description></item></channel></rss>
