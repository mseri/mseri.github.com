One possible fix is to delete homebrew and reinstall everything but I am too lazy and too attached to my list of installed packages to accept it.
The first error I&amp;rsquo;ve got while running brew update was related to missing system ruby 1.8. This appears because OSX finally updated to ruby 2.</description></item><item><title>nginx, ghost 0.3.3 and modsecurity</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/nginx-ghost-0-3-3-and-modsecurity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2013 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/nginx-ghost-0-3-3-and-modsecurity/</guid><description>In my previous post, Ghost on Amazon EC2 without using sudo, I was proposing some way of running ghost without having to use sudo and with at least a minimal eye on security.
If you have followed one of the guides that I suggested, namely Dude Looks Like a Ghost, or you have installed your own modsecurity configuration you should have received a big page announcing an Error 403 right after the update of your ghost to version 0.</description></item></channel></rss>
