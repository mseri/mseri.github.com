<span class=posts-list-item-description><span>The upcoming block I have to coordinate a course on giving good talks. This also meant looking for good extra material for the students to reflect on what it means to give a good talk, what to be aware of and what tips can help to do a good job. Here is a collection of the resources I liked so far:
MAA has a curated list of resources on giving mathematics talks which includes plenty of examples of good mathematics presentations There is an essay by John McCarthy on how to give a good colloquium talk with a response blog post on how to give a good 20min talk On the blog of the AMS there is a nice post on preparing a conference presentation, from what it means to many resources on how it can be done What characterizes a good presentation?</span><br><span><svg xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg>1 min read -

I joined other four incredible panelists and we have been given in advance five quite broad (and though) questions on some important aspects of (high) education.

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span>The other day I found an old file with links to interesting videos. Some of them were no longer available, some I still have to check, but one caught my attention and the other evening I decided to watch it.
It is a little documentary on the last conference of Donald Coexeter, and I enjoed watching it very much. You can find it embedded below, and linked above. And while collecting links for this post I have also discovered a nice writeup.</span><br><span><svg xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg>1 min read -

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span>Since September I am a member of the Young Academy Groningen. One of the nice perks of being part of such incredible group of people (yes, I still wonder how I got there :P) was the opportunity to take a short course on dealing with the media and to record my &ldquo;research minutes&rdquo;, a short, 2 minutes long, video to popularize my work.

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span>Last year I had the opportunity to give the first talk at the The Dutch Differential Topology & Geometry seminar (DDT&amp;G). This was a 3 hour long event in which I had the chance to give a high-level introduction to sub-Riemannian geometry and present some interesting results and open questions partly related to my research.
In the first part of the seminar I introduced what are sub-Riemannian structures, where do they come from and what are some of the major properties and open questions, using some famous examples to drive the discussion.</span><br><span><svg xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg>2 min read -

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span>During the current incarnation of the course in Hamiltonian Mechanics I have collected some amount of material to share with the students. To avoid losing it in the guts of our teaching CMS, I leave it here for posterity, practically copy-pasting it without edits because I am really tired :D

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span>In the previous academic term I had the pleasure to teach Analysis on Manifolds, essentially an introduction to differential geometry for third year students.
In the course I tried to address the topic with the perspective that some of the students would be joining also my master course in Hamiltonian Mechanics later on next year. So many of the topics go in the direction of introducing the prerequisites for studying flows, symplectic geometry and sub-Riemannian geometry.</span><br><span><svg xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg>1 min read -

Given the current global circumstances, the course was given via Zoom and the organizers and participants have been kind enough to have it recorded and published online.

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span>In the last academic term, I had the great pleasure to teach Hamiltonian Mechanics, an optional master course for mathematics and physics students. Even though the course was based on Arnold&rsquo;s beautiful book, my plan for the course was to give a panoramic on the modern theory of integrable systems and perturbation theory. Of course, my grand plan, was way to optimistic. And between the time available, a bad flu and then the pandemic landing, we were able to do much less than what I hoped for.</span><br><span><svg xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg>2 min read -
