This contains some edits to improve the english and fix a few typos.
The lecture notes have also been approved to appear in the &lt;a href="https://www.ams.org/open-math-notes/omn-view-listing?listingId=110861">AMS Open Math Notes&lt;/a>, which seems to be a very nice initiative, full of very interesting and high quality content.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lecture notes on Hamiltonian mechanics</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/lecture-notes-hamiltonian-mechanics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 15:20:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/lecture-notes-hamiltonian-mechanics/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the last academic term, I had the great pleasure to teach Hamiltonian Mechanics, an optional master course for mathematics and physics students.
Even though the course was based on Arnold&amp;rsquo;s beautiful book, my plan for the course was to give a panoramic on the modern theory of integrable systems and perturbation theory. Of course, my grand plan, was way to optimistic. And between the time available, a bad flu and then the pandemic landing, we were able to do much less than what I hoped for.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
